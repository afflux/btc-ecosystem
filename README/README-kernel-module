- The Makefile probably has to be adjusted to have to correct path (KERNEL_ARM) to the linux sources that will be used for the ARM based board
- To icompile for the developent/ host system the header package for the current kernel has to be installed.
  (At the time of writing the ubuntu package might be: linux-headers-3.13.0-24-generic, but normally this is already installed)
  If this is present, do
$> make all-intel
- To compile for the ARM board, the ARM cross-compiler (ubuntu package: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf) has to be installed. Then do
$> make all-arm

To make udev assign the right privilegs to the device file, link the "99-sha256_accel.rules" file in the rules directory:
$> sudo ln -s 99-sha256_accel.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
